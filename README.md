# Quantum-Penny-Flip-Game-Simulation
An interactive game in python using Qiskit to simulate a quantum version of the penny flip game. 
## Overview
This coding project is a detailed simulation of the Quantum Penny Flip game which has important consequenses to the field of game theory. It shows that employing a quantum strategy can create new outcomes and equilibriums. 

## Key Features
*   **Qiskit-based Quantum Simulation:** Utilizes the Qiskit library for robust quantum state manipulation.
*   **Bloch Sphere Visualization:** Dynamically plots qubit states on the Bloch sphere to intuitively represent superposition and transformations.
*   **Quantum Gate Application:** Demonstrates the effects of Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), and Identity (ID) gates on qubit states.
*   **Interactive Learning:** Designed as a Google Colab notebook for easy execution and exploration of the game's mechanics.

## Technologies Used
*   Python
*   Qiskit
*   Matplotlib
*   NumPy
